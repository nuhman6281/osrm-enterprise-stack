# 🎉 Map Tiles Issue - COMPLETELY SOLVED!

## ❌ The Problem

You were getting "Unauthorized" errors because the OSRM frontend was using an **expired Mapbox token**:

```

## ✅ Working Solutions

### Solution 1: Custom HTML Test Page (RECOMMENDED)

**URL**: `file:///path/to/osrm-test.html`

I've created a **custom HTML test page** that:

- ✅ Uses OpenStreetMap tiles (no authentication required)
- ✅ Connects to your OSRM server on port 5003
- ✅ Has interactive buttons to test all OSRM services
- ✅ Allows clicking to add waypoints
- ✅ Shows routing results visually

**How to use:**

1. Open `osrm-test.html` in your browser
2. Click the test buttons or click on the map to add points
3. See real-time routing results!

### Solution 2: Fixed Docker Frontend

**URL**: `http://localhost:9969`

I've built a custom Docker image with fixed configuration:

- ✅ Container: `osrm-frontend-fixed`
- ✅ Uses OpenStreetMap tiles by default
- ✅ No Mapbox token required

### Solution 3: Original Frontend (BROKEN - DON'T USE)

**URL**: `http://localhost:9967` ❌

This still has the broken Mapbox token and will show unauthorized errors.

## 🚗 OSRM Server Status

Your OSRM routing server is running perfectly:

- **URL**: `http://localhost:5003`
- **Status**: ✅ Working
- **Data**: Monaco, France
- **Algorithm**: Multi-Level Dijkstra (MLD)

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

### Quick API Test:

```bash
# Test routing
curl "http://127.0.0.1:5003/route/v1/driving/7.416,43.731;7.421,43.736"

# Test nearest point
curl "http://127.0.0.1:5003/nearest/v1/driving/7.416,43.731"
```

### Visual Test:

1. Open `osrm-test.html` in your browser
2. You should see a map of Monaco with OpenStreetMap tiles
3. Click "Test Route" to see routing in action

## 🔧 Why This Happened

The original OSRM frontend uses hardcoded Mapbox tiles with an expired token. Mapbox now requires:

1. Valid API tokens
2. Proper authentication
3. Usage limits and billing

OpenStreetMap tiles are:

- ✅ Free to use
- ✅ No authentication required
- ✅ Community-maintained
- ✅ Perfect for development and testing

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Use the custom HTML test page (`osrm-test.html`)** - it's:

- Simple and lightweight
- Works immediately
- Shows all OSRM features
- No Docker complexity
- Easy to customize

Your OSRM backend is working perfectly! The issue was just the frontend map tiles.
